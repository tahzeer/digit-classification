# Digit Classification

This repository contains a digit classification project. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The project uses the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Model

The classification model is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library. It utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Usage

To run the digit classification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file.

2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Digit_Classification.ipynb` to access the project code and documentation. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train and evaluate the classification model.

4. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different algorithms or techniques to improve the classification performance.

## Results

The project achieves an accuracy nearing 100% on the test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented classification model.
